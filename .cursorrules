API docs location:

- Default API documentation file is docs/api.md
- If multiple services exist, use docs/api/<service-name>.md

API documentation rule (MANDATORY):

- Any change to an API (endpoint, method, URL, request body, query params, headers, response shape, status codes, or behavior)
  MUST be accompanied by an update to the API documentation Markdown file.
- If an API docs file does not exist, create one (e.g. docs/api.md or API.md).
- Documentation updates must be done in the same change as the code update.

Documentation requirements:

- Clearly specify:
  - Endpoint and HTTP method
  - Request parameters (path, query, body)
  - Authentication/authorization requirements
  - Example request and response
  - Possible error responses
- Ensure examples match the actual implementation exactly.
- Never leave documentation outdated or “TODO”.

Enforcement:

- If the user asks to change an API but does not mention documentation,
  you MUST still update the API docs.
- If you are unsure whether a change affects the API,
  assume it does and update the docs.
